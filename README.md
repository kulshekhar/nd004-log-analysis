# ND004 Log Analysis

The code is contained in a single file - `log_analysis.py`. Python 2.7 was used during development.

The code declares queries for the three tasks, establishes a connection, executes the queries and displays the results.

To run it, execute `python2.7 log_analysis.py` or, if the file has execution permissions, execute `./log_analysis.py`. This assumes you're in the directory where this file is located.
